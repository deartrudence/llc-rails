        #Today&rsquo;s project

        We're going to be data scientists!

        We'll learn to process, manipulate, and sort data using open datasets from [open.canada.ca](http://open.canada.ca). These kind of programs that 'parse' data are used frequently in web apps such as [Open Parliament](https://openparliament.ca/).

        Today, you'll learn to 'think' like a computer as you gather insights from open data provided by The Government of Canada.

        * **Windows**: http://rubyinstaller.org/
        * **Mac**: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
        * Ruby comes by default on Mac OSX and the above link is for different versions!
      1. Text editor - today we'll be using **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**
      1. Terminal/Console
      1. [Learner files](https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-intro-to-ruby-data/archive/master.zip) (contains exercise and solution files)

        #Creating the application

        Next, type these commands in the terminal:


        ```
        > mkdir projects
        ```
        You can verify that a directory named **projects** was created by running the list command: `ls`. You should see the **projects** directory in the output. Now you want to change the directory you are currently in to the **projects** folder by running:

        ```
        > cd projects
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Creating the application

        You can verify you are now in an empty directory or folder by again running the `ls` command.

        Now you want to create a new app called **railsgirls** by running:.

        ```
        > rails new railsgirls
        ```

        This will create a new app in the folder **railsgirls**, so we again want to change the directory to be inside of our rails app by running:

        ```
        > cd railsgirls
        ```
      </script>
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Running the application

        If you run ls inside of the directory you should see folders such as `app` and `config`. You can then start the rails server by running:

        ```
        > rails server
        ```

        Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/RunServer.png)

        You should see “Welcome aboard” page, which means that the generation of your new app worked correctly.

    </section>

    <section class="slide no-bullet-list" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Stopping the application

        Notice in this window the command prompt is not visible because you are now in the Rails server, the command prompt looks like this:

        ```
        => Booting WEBrick
        => Rails 4.2.5 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
        => Run rails server -h for more startup options
        => Ctrl-C to shutdown server
        [2016-01-12 18:10:44] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1

        [2016-01-12 18:10:44] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=46216 port=3000
        ```
        When the command prompt is not visible you cannot execute new commands. If you try running `cd` or another command it will not work. To return to the normal command prompt:

        Hit `Ctrl`+`C` in the terminal to quit the server.

        #Create Idea scaffold

        We’re going to use Rails’ **scaffold** functionality to generate a starting point that allows us to list, add, remove, edit, and view things; in our case ideas.

        ```ruby
        rails generate scaffold idea name:string description:text picture:string
        ```

        The scaffold creates new files in your project directory, but to get it to work properly we need to run a couple of other commands to update our database and restart the server.

        ```ruby
        bin/rake db:migrate
        rails server
        ```

        Open http://localhost:3000/ideas in your browser.

        Hit `Ctrl`+`C` to quit the server again when you’ve clicked around a little.

        ## Twitter Bootstrap

        The app doesn’t look very nice yet. Let’s do something about that. We’ll use the Twitter Bootstrap project to give us nicer styling really easily.

        Open app/views/layouts/application.html.erb in your text editor and above the line

        ```ruby
        <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
        ```

        add

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="//railsgirls.com/assets/bootstrap-theme.css">
        ```
        and replace

        ```
        <%= yield %>

        with
        ```

        ## Navigation & Footer

        Let’s also add a navigation bar and footer to the layout. In the same file, under <body> add


        ```html
        <nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
          <div class="container">

                <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
              </button>
              <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">The Idea app</a>
            </div>
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
              <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
                <li class="active"><a href="/ideas">Ideas</a></li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </nav>
        ```

        and before </body> add
        ```
        <footer>
          <div class="container">
            Rails Girls 2015
          </div>
        </footer>
        ```

        somehow add the script
`<script src="//railsgirls.com/assets/bootstrap.js"></script>`

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Design
        ##Styling

        Now let’s also change the styling of the ideas table. Open app/assets/stylesheets/application.css and at the bottom add

        ```css
        body { padding-top: 100px; }
        footer { margin-top: 100px; }
        table, td, th { vertical-align: middle; border: none; }
        th { border-bottom: 1px solid #DDD; }
        ```

        Now make sure you saved your files and refresh the browser to see what was changed. You can also change the HTML & CSS further.

        gem 'sqlite3
        ```
        add
        ```
        gem 'carrierwave'

        ```ruby
        root :to => 'ideas#index'

        Lets add a static page to our app that will hold information about the author of this application — you!

        ```
        rails generate controller pages info
        ```

        This command will create you a new folder under `app/views` called `/pages` and under that a file called `info.html.erb` which will be your info page.

        It also adds a new simple route to your routes.rb.

        ```
        get "pages/info"

        Now you can open the file `app/views/pages/info.html.erb` and add information about you in HTML. To see your new info page, take your browser to http://localhost:3000/pages/info or, if you are a cloud service user, append ‘/pages/info’ to your preview url.

        irb(main):001:0> print 3.to_s + " items in my bento!"
        3 items in my bento! => nil

        ```

        The ability to tell Ruby to change the type will come in handy later.

        #Variables
        In programming, we usually want to store a value to use later.
        **Variables** store data in your computer&rsquo;s memory.

        Use a **variable name** to fetch their value (kind of like a bookmark in a book). The equal (`=`) symbol *assigns* a value to a variable.

        Let's go over these example:

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> x = 5
        irb(main):001:0> y = 4
        irb(main):001:0> x * y
        20
        ```

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> today = "Saturday"
        irb(main):001:0> print "Today is " + today
        Today is Saturday
        ```
        You can store almost anything in a variable.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after you&rsquo;ve assigned the value by "reassigning" them.

        ```ruby
        # Remember, we've already set x = 5 and y = 4
        irb(main):001:0> y = 10
        irb(main):001:0> x * y
        ```

        What do you think the value of `x * y` will be? <span class="delayed">50</span>

        Why?
        You changed <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->`y`, but the old value of `x` is still in memory.
        Ruby will remember variable names until you close IRB.

        * can only use letters, numbers and the underscore (`_`); no spaces

        * cannot begin with a number

        #Working with user input

        So far, we&rsquo;ve used the console to output message on the screen. Now let's write a program that can say hello to anyone!

        Use the `gets` method to receive data typed into the console. Then you'll see a blank line and the cursor. Type your name in the blank line.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> gets
        Sarah
        ```
        Ruby returns the name plus a `\n`. (We'll deal with the `\n` later.)

        ```ruby
        => "Sarah\n"
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Working with user input: Variables

        Generally, we set the value returned by `gets` to a **variable**.

        ```ruby
        # Set variable 'name' to value of 'gets'
        irb(main):001:0> name = gets
        ```

        Then add your name to the blank line.
        ```ruby
        # Set variable 'name' to value of 'gets'
        irb(main):001:0> name = gets
        # Add a value for 'name'
        Sarah
        ```

        Now, *call* the variable using `name` and it will return the assigned value.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> name
        => "Sarah\n"
        ```
      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #What is `\n`?

        `\n` is Ruby's way of putting a *new line* after the input.
        Use the method `chomp` to remove the last character of a string.

        Let's create a program in the console that will remove the `\n` character.

        1.&nbsp;Give a `puts` message to let your user know what you&rsquo;re looking for.
        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> puts "What is your name?"
        ```
        ```ruby
        #outputs:
        What is your name?
        => nil
        ```

        2.&nbsp;Define a `name` variable and assign the value of `gets` to it.
        Add `chomp` to remove the new line character.
        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> name = gets.chomp
        ```

        3.&nbsp;Type your name in the blank line and hit the **enter** key. The value will be  *returned* to you.

        ```
        irb(main):001:0> name = gets.chomp
        Sarah
        => "Sarah"
        ```

        4.&nbsp;Type the variable `name` and **enter**.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> name
        => "Sarah"
        ```

        The name *value* is now assigned to the *variable* and will return without the `\n` character!

        #Working with a Text Editor

        Typing into the console is fine to start, but do you really want to type your program every time you run it?

        Let's open our **exercises** folder in Atom to get ready to work in the text editor instead of the console. This will also make it easier to write larger blocks of code.

        Inside of the folder you downloaded today, there a few other folders.

          |-- slides.html // This is the file you are viewing right now!

        Open Atom and go to **File > Add Project Folder**.

        A popup will appear. Then:

        * navigate to the **llc-intro-to-ruby-data-master** folder

          ```ruby

          print "Please enter your name: "

          # Assign the input value to a variable

        # Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 2)

        Code in a file is just text until you **run** it through the Ruby program.

        We'll need to navigate to the location of your saved **hello.rb** file using `cd` (change directory) and `ls` (list files).

        Open a new tab in the console. The directory location will default to your user directory and will look something like this:

        ```
        Computer-Name:~ yourusername$
        ```

        Type `ls` at the end of this line to list the directories.

        If you saved today's files to your *desktop*, type the command `cd Desktop` to navigate to that folder.

        ```
        Computer-Name:~ yourusername$ cd Desktop
        ```

        Navigate only to the **exercises** folder (not the `hello.rb` file).

        ---
        ###Pro tip!
        You can continue to use `cd` and `ls` to get to your *exercises* directory OR just type `cd` and *drag* the folder from your Finder/Explorer into the console!

        ```
        Computer-Name:exercises yourusername$ ruby hello.rb
        ```

        The program should now execute the first line in the `hello.rb` file and ask for your name.

        Type in your name and hit `Enter` again and it will say hello to you. It will look something like this:

        ```
        Computer-Name:exercises yourusername$ ruby hello.rb
        Please enter your name: Trudy
        Hello Trudy
        Computer-Name:exercises yourusername$

        How does `if` know what&rsquo;s `True` or `False`? We use 'Boolean' statements to test against values.

        Reminder, one equals symbol only *assigns* a value to the variable.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> weather = "raining"
        ```

        To test the values, the double equals symbol (`==`) will evaluate if the value on the right matches the assigned value.
        ```
        irb(main):001:0> weather == "cold"
        => false
        irb(main):001:0> weather == "raining"
        => true
        ```
        We can use these *statements* with our `if` values to test the weather conditions.

        # String Interpolation

        **[I think we can take this out since it doesn't look like the final project needs it.]**

        Ruby uses string Interpolation to add variables to strings for output.

        When you want to print results ruby needs a way of knowing what is meant to be the exact word and what is meant to be a variable.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> if weather == "cold"
              print "the weather today is #{weather}"
            end

        The `#{weather}` tells ruby to use the variable weather, rather than just outputing the word 'weather'.
        Try typing each example into the command line.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> weather = "cold"
        irb(main):001:0> print "the weather today is weather"

        In order to make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions at a time.

        In the `no-emissions.csv` file, each line of the file represents a country and the amount of nitrogen oxide emissions during a period of time.

        Let&rsquo;s print out a few individual lines.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> emissions = File.open('./exercises/no-emissions.csv')
        irb(main):001:0> puts emissions.readline()
        => "\"Nitrogen oxide emissions by country, 2002 and 2012\",,,,\r\n"

        irb(main):001:0> puts emissions.readline()
        => ",,,,\r\n"

        irb(main):001:0> puts emissions.readline()
        => "Country,2002 Nitrogen oxide emissions (kilotonnes),2012 Nitrogen oxide emissions... etc."

        irb(main):001:0> puts emissions.readline()
        => "United States,21632,12258,1.8,0.9\r\n"

        irb(main):001:0> emissions.close()
        ```

        # Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        Let's take closer look at the four printed lines from the previous example.

        ```
        "\"Nitrogen oxide emissions by country, 2002 and 2012\",,,,\r\n"
        ",,,,\r\n"
        "Country,2002 Nitrogen oxide emissions (kilotonnes),2012 Nitrogen oxide emissions... etc."
        "United States,21632,12258,1.8,0.9\r\n"
        ```

        The first line is the title of the file, the second a space, the third is a legend, and the fourth is the first entry.

        Notice that all three lines have columns, separated by a comma (`,`)

        Dividing columns by commas is called Comma Separated Values, or **CSV** that is used to represent spreadsheet-like data.

        # Reading all the lines in a file

        It&rsquo;s all well and good to print out the lines in a file one-at-a-time, but surely, there&rsquo;s a better way to read *all* the lines in a file.

        To perform the same action many times in a row, use **loops**. In Ruby, there are lots of types of loops! The example below uses a `for` loop.

        To print each of the rows in the file, use the following code sample:

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> emissions = File.open('./exercises/no-emissions.csv')
        irb(main):002:0> for line in emissions
        irb(main):003:1> puts line
        irb(main):004:1> end
        irb(main):001:0> emissions.close()
        ```

        # Libraries

        ruby has wonderful built in **libraries** which are collections of code that other people have written. Today we&rsquo;ll use the **csv** library. It contains instructions that tell ruby how to work with CSV files.

        This library will help us makes sense of the data contained in a CSV file to learn more from Canada's Open Data.

        # Using a library

        So far, we've been writing all our code in the console or in one file. When you use a library, you don't want to copy all that code into your file, otherwise it would become huge!

        In ruby, you can **require** the functions and other structures so you can use the code without having it in your file. Then you can use functions (and other structures) to do your bidding!

        In your console, import the `csv` library as follows.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> require 'csv'
        ```
<!-- TEMP: I don't think you can do this in IRB
        If you then type `csv.` and wait, it will show you a list of everything in that module.

        # Reading data from a CSV file

        The CSV libary has a number of different tools for extracting actual data from a CSV file. Instead of a line of comma-separated values, we can access individual values easily (like the cells of a spreadsheet).

        We can use for loops on CSV files!

        * First we open the file
        * Then, we require the `csv` library
        * Then read it!

        <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.2/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html#method-c-readlines">Ruby Docs</a> have a list of all functions available in CSV.

          ```
          irb(main):001:0> require 'csv'
          irb(main):001:0> emissions_file = CSV.open('./exercises/no-emissions.csv')
          irb(main):014:0> emissions_file.read
          ```
          ** Notice how the data is parsed acording to the commas? This means we can read the data by column or by row!

        # Dictionaries

        This time, when we printed the values from the CSV file, instead of getting comma-separated values, we got a `dict`ionary representing each row in the file.

        Instead of having to remember which *column* represents city, we can access it with a keyword:

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> chapter = {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}
        irb(main):001:0> print(chapter['City'])
        Vancouver
        irb(main):001:0> print(chapter['Province'])
        BC
        irb(main):001:0> print(chapter['Chapter Lead(s)'])
        Meghan

        # Working in a `for` loop

        Before lunch, we learned how the `for` loops can repeat the same set of intructions on a collection of things - like our CSV rows.

        * The `for` loop assigns *each row* in turn to the `emissions` variable
        * We group instructions together with the same indentation
        * All the instructions in the indented block, are run for each `chapter`

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> require 'csv'
        irb(main):041:0> CSV.foreach('./exercises/no-emissions.csv') do |row|
        irb(main):042:1* puts row[0].to_s + " emitted " + row[1].to_s + " kilotonnes of nitrogen oxide in 2002."
        irb(main):043:1> end
        ...
        United States emitted 21632 kilotonnes of nitrogen oxide in 2002.
        Canada emitted 2529 kilotonnes of nitrogen oxide in 2002.
        Australia emitted 1586 kilotonnes of nitrogen oxide in 2002.

        # Counting loops

        Sometimes you want to keep track of the number of times something happened.

        We can add `1` to the current value of a variable, and assign it back to the same variable. ruby processes everything to the right of the `=` before assignining the result.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> count = 0
        irb(main):001:0> count = count + 1
        irb(main):001:0> print count
        1
        ```
        We can count the number of countries in **no-emissions.csv** if we increase by one each time it loops.

        ```ruby
        # file: exercises/demo_loop_count.rb
        require 'csv'

        count = 0

        CSV.foreach("no-emissions.csv") do |row|
          count += 1
        end

        count -= 3

        # Finding a word in a string

        So far, we've compared entire strings to each other `"ruby" == "ruby"`.

        But what if you want to find a word inside an existing string?

        ruby has a `.find()` function available on `str` types that tells you where another string appears – its **index**.

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> "Ladies Learning Code".include?("Code")
        => true
        ```

        The `.inlcude?()` function is case-sensitive – it will only match the *exact* string you pass it, even if the only difference is `C` vs `c`.

        # Exercise 5: Comparing Rent in Canadian Cities (15 mins)
        Now that you know how to find a string within a string, we are going to look at some more data!
        We are going to switch to using the file rent-data.csv, which is the file we will use in our final project!

<!-- TEMP: This might need a more thorough explanation of the data -->
        If you open the **rent-data.csv** file you can see that both provinces and cities are listed for the historical rent data.

        Remember, `.include?()` returns 'true' if the search string is in the row and 'false' if it is not.

        Create a new file **ex5_city_rent_comparison.rb** and use what you've learned to find the rent prices in neighboring cities.

        * Print a list of cities in your chosen provinces
        * Print the city with the most expensive rent

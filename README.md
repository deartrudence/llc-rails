#Ladies Learning Code

##Intro to Ruby

A full day introductory Ruby workshop.

Created by [Sarah Beck](https://twitter.com/essefbeck) and [Trudy MacNabb]() based on Introduction to Python created by [Gabriel Gosselin](https://twitter.com/fggosselin) and [Darcie Milliken](https://twitter.com/derushie) for Ladies Learning Code.

### Contributing

This project uses [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to maintain consistent coding style. Make sure your text editor has an editorconfig [plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) installed.

**Atom Users:** The Whitespace plugin (which is installed by default) has `Trim trailing whitespace` option turned on by default. Turn this off in the Whitespace plugin settings, otherwise it overwrites the setting in [.editorconfig](.editorconfig). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig/issues/3).
